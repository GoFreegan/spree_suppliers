This is an extension to run on top of spree 0.60.3 rails ecommerce engine.

This extension provides functionality to use multiple suppliers/vendors, each selling their own products, but using a unified listing view so the customer is not affected by this and only makes one transaction. On the backend, smaller sub-orders called supplier invoices are created by grouping the products in an order by each product's supplier_id. A subtotal is generated for each supplier invoice, so the spree administrator can send out invoices to each supplier.

To install: 

you must first have a running rails app:
  rails new spree_suppliers_test
  cd spree_suppliers_test

You must also have a running Spree store:
  Add to Gemfile:
  gem 'rails', '3.0.9'
  gem 'spree', '0.60.3'

then run: 
  bundle install
  rake spree:install
  rake db:migrate
  rake db:seed
  rake db:admin:create

To install the spree_suppliers extension:
Add to Gemfile:
  gem 'spree_suppliers', :git => 'git://github.com/johndavid400/spree_suppliers.git'

run the following:
  bundle install
  rake spree_suppliers:install
  rake db:migrate

_---------------------------

Before being able to check out, go to /admin and do the following things:
1. create a vendor (with valid address)
2. create a shipping method
3. create a payment method (use check as test)
4. edit vendor - add shipping option
5. add pickup and pickup location for vendor
6. add product for vendor - then edit to assign new product to the vendor

Go through checkout process normally, then check orders page on the admin panel to view the details of an order and all supplier invoices that are created.

There is a mailer in place that will send each individual supplier an email anytime a purchase is made from them. It will not show them the entire order, only the products purchased from them. The mailer is disabled (commented out) as there is no email smtp information yet. Once you fill this in, you can re-enable the mailer to send out emails.
